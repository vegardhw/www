This is my little corner of the web where I write about everything I find interesting in terms of technology. Topics will include the Microsoft Cloud, DevOps, Infrastructure-as-Code, automation, tips and tricks for VSCode, but also consumer-oriented stuff like home automation and productivity tools.

Personal opinions are my own.
